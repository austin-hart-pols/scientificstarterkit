# The business end

## Scientific inquiry

1. Question
2. Observation
3. Testing
4. Inference


## Scientific questions

### Investigate "effects of causes"
- Ingredients of a sci question
  - Exposure variable: cause, $X$
  - Outcome variable: effect, $Y$

> What is the effect of a plant-based diet (X)
on longevity (Y)?


## Theory as guideline and baseline

- Theory: what we *think* we know about $X \rightarrow Y$
  - School of thought A suggests...
  - School B suggests...

- Hypotheses: observable implications of theory
  - In my study, School A predicts...
  - School B predicts...

> Theories are general stories about the way things work. 
> Hypotheses are specific predictions, derived from theory, about what we will observe in the data.


## Observation

- Design a study
  - Experiment (randomized controlled trial)
  - Observational (epidemiological)
  - Maybe both!
  
- Collect your data


## Testing and inference

- Test the data against hypotheses

- Inferential leaps
  - Is there a relationship? (statistical validity)
  - Is it causal? (internal validity)
  - Does it capture what you intended? (measurement validity)
  - Is the effect general? (external validity)


# Nature and radical origins

## Modern scientific project

*New Organon* (1620)
by Sir Francis Bacon

Inductive reasoning as foundation for a new scientific order


## What makes it radical?

- Understanding through observation
- Safeguard against confirmation bias

- Challenge status quo without
  - revelation or divination
  - appeal to traditional authority
  
  
## Behold, the revolution!
